Created with CodeSandbox

# Start

# Next steps:

- The "slugs" I mapped through was supposed to be coming from an array of slugs from the backend to map through and display for the user, but unfortunately ran out of time before I could figure it out.
- Saving to the database was a big blocker, I would like to research more how to send data to the backend using these new technologies, especcially useMutation and useQuery.
  -Styling needs to be completely done (looking back I wish I took a break every now and then to at least do some styling. Spent majority of time researching docs).
